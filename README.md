# MvvmBasicStructure
In this basic structure project we created 3 packages
        1. model: Holds data & business logic

        2. view: Display layer, android specific logics, 
                 activities, fragments, layouts etc

        3. viewModel: The ViewModel is used to establish relationships 
                      between providers, 
                      lifecycle management, 
                      and availability.
